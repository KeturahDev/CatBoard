# CatBoardInterface+Api
### By **Keturah Howard, Jamison Cozart, Dusty McCord, Zakkrey Short**  March 30th 2020

Repo holding ASP.NET core MVC application to display views that interact with the CatBoardApi application and the Api.

## Specifications user stories:

* As a user, I want to be able to GET all messages related to a specific group.
* As a user, I want to be able to POST messages to a specific group.
* As a user, I want to be able to see a list of all groups.
* As a user, I want to input date parameters and retrieve only messages posted during that timeframe.
* As a user, I want to be able to PUT and DELETE messages, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
